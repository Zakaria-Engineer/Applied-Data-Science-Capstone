# Applied Data Science Capstone: SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction üöÄ

Welcome to my Applied Data Science Capstone project! In this project, I aim to predict whether the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches at a cost of **$62 million**, significantly lower than other providers, which can charge upwards of **$165 million**. This cost efficiency is largely due to SpaceX's ability to reuse the first stage of the rocket. By determining the likelihood of a successful landing, we can provide valuable insights for competitive pricing and operational efficiency.

## Project Overview üìú
In this capstone, I take on the role of a data scientist for a fictional rocket company, **Space Y**. My primary goal is to gather information about SpaceX and create dashboards to analyze launch data. I also developped machine learning models to predict the success of Falcon 9 first-stage landings, which will help Space Y determine competitive launch pricing.

## Learning Objectives üéØ
By the end of this project, I was be able to:
- Develop Python code to manipulate data in a Pandas DataFrame.
- Convert JSON files into Pandas DataFrames.
- Utilize data science methodologies to define and formulate real-world business problems.
- Collect data through the SpaceX API and web scraping techniques.
- Load datasets, clean them, and extract meaningful insights.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualize data using Python libraries.
- Build and evaluate predictive models using machine learning techniques.

## About the SpaceX Launch Dataset üìÇ

The [`spacex_launch_dash.csv`](https://github.com/Zakaria-Engineer/Applied-Data-Science-Capstone/blob/main/spacex_launch_dash.csv) dataset provides detailed information on Falcon 9 launches conducted by SpaceX. It includes the following key features:

- **Flight Number**: A unique identifier for each launch.
- **Launch Site**: The location from which the rocket was launched.
- **Class**: Indicates whether the launch was successful or unsuccessful.
- **Payload Mass (kg)**: The mass of the payload being launched, measured in kilograms.
- **Booster Version**: The specific version of the Falcon 9 booster used for the launch.
- **Booster Version Category**: A categorical representation of the booster version.

I collected data through the SpaceX API and web scraping techniques, followed by data wrangling to ensure quality and consistency. This approach ensured that the dataset was both current and comprehensive, allowing for thorough analysis and accurate predictions regarding the success of Falcon 9 first-stage landings.
